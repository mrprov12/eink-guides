Here’s a step-by-step guide for sideloading KOReader onto your AiPaper device.

## Steps to Install KOReader

1. **Install a File Manager:**
   - Use APKPure (available in the AiPaper App Store) to install a file manager. I used **FX File Explorer**, which works well for managing APK files.

2. **Download the KOReader APK:**
   - Open Chrome on your AiPaper and go to the KOReader [GitHub page](https://github.com/koreader/koreader).
   - Follow their installation guide, which will take you to the [releases page](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/releases).
   - Scroll down to the **Assets** section and download the latest version, such as `koreader-android-arm-v2024.07.apk`.

3. **Install KOReader:**
   - Once the download completes, open FX File Explorer.
   - Navigate to the **Download** folder and click on `koreader-android-arm-v2024.07.apk` to start the installation.
   - If prompted to allow installation from unknown sources, follow the prompt to **Settings**, enable unknown sources, and return to complete the installation.

4. **Using KOReader on AiPaper:**
   - KOReader doesn’t respond to AiPaper’s physical "Back" button, so to exit, use the in-app KOReader menu instead.
   - The **Power button** works as usual, so you can sleep and wake the device while using KOReader without issue.

5. **Updating KOReader in the Future:**
   - For future updates, download the latest `.apk` file and repeat the steps above. Selecting the new `.apk` will prompt an update rather than reinstalling, and your settings (like Calibre wireless sync) should remain unchanged.

**Extra Tip:** If downloading directly to the AiPaper isn’t possible, you can also use [FTP (file transfer protocol)](./FTPonAiPaper.md) to transfer the `.apk` file to your device.

Hope this helps! Enjoy reading with KOReader!
