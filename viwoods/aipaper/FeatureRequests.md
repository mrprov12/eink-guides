# Version 3.1.2

## AiPaper
1) **Screen Rotation & Lock**: The ability to rotate and lock screen orientation would be fantastic. When writing in portrait mode, my hand often hits the bottom buttons, pulling me to the Home Screen. When turning the device to write in landscape, my hand occasionally triggers the menu. If I could lock the screen in normal portrait, landscape, or 180° in portrait (with the top-right menu moving with the orientation), it would prevent accidental button presses. Alternatively, a lock for the bottom buttons would allow uninterrupted writing—perhaps something you could add to the top-right or left-hand menu, or activate with a gesture.

2) **ChatGPT Account Integration**: It would be great to sign into my ChatGPT account directly on the AiPaper system AI. While I can install the ChatGPT app via APKPure, I'd like to connect my (paid) account to the system AI and choose the model I'd like to use systemwide.

3) **Folder Structure in Learning**: Adding folders and subfolders in Learning, or a Library-like feature to categorize epubs, would help in organizing content. Currently, I categorize epubs in Calibre, but after transferring them to AiPaper, they end up in a single folder, making it hard to find specific items.

4) **Adjustable Line Spacing and Custom Fonts in epubs in Learning**: Adjustable line spacing and support for custom fonts would improve readability in the Learning section.

5) **Folders in Meetings & Pickings**: Support for folders and subfolders in both Meetings and Pickings would help organize content.

6) **Subfolders in Paper**: Adding subfolders in Paper would be similarly useful for note organization.

7) **Daily Linkage for Created Content**: Could the Daily section track all created content (e.g., pages, annotated PDFs, epubs in Learning) by date? This would make it easier to see everything created on a specific day, with tabs for each type (Tasks, Notes, Paper, Meetings, Learning, Pickings) or an all-encompassing “Created” tab. This might eliminate the need for Planner templates as all activity would be visible in the Daily view.

8) **Quick Access to Tasks & Notes**: **(Menu)** – Adding Tasks and Notes buttons to the top-right dropdown menu where clicking the button opened up a modal on screen that allowed you to check off a task or write a note would allow quick access to jot something down without leaving the current screen. Renaming ‘Notes’ to ‘Quick Notes’ might also clarify its function, as ‘Paper’ serves as the primary note-taking space. **(Lock Screen)** – Adding Tasks and Notes buttons on the lock screen (with gestures like “swipe up from the bottom left” for Tasks and “swipe up from the bottom right” for Notes) would offer quick access.

9) **Handwriting-to-Text in Tasks**: The Daily Task list would benefit from automatic handwriting-to-text conversion and tappable checkboxes, enabling check-offs, sorting, and prioritization of tasks with filtering options.

10) **Additional Fonts & Custom Screensavers**: Support for adding system fonts and custom screensavers (.png) would offer more personalization options.

11) **Greyscale Drawing Options & Blender Brush in Paper**: Greyscale colors (similar to the Supernote) and a blending brush for pencil would make the device more suitable for sketching. You could enhance the Paper app with these tools or consider a separate drawing app, as this has the potential to be a great sketchbook.

12) **Stylus Button Customization**: Customizing the action of the stylus’ physical button would allow greater workflow personalization. For instance, I noticed a user request to set it as a lasso tool.

13) **Unlimited Scroll in Paper & Meetings**: Unlimited scrolling in Paper and Meetings documents would prevent interruptions when taking notes and would enable the AI Assistant to view more than the current page.

14) **Naming Pages/Sections in Long Documents**: The option to name pages or sections in long documents would help navigation, allowing a type of Table of Contents and aiding the AI Assistant’s ability to analyze a full document.

15) **Customizable Home Screen Boxes**: I don’t use Pickings, so the ability to replace it on the Home Screen with a specific Paper folder or another custom option would be helpful.

16) **Customizable Home Screen Apps**: Lastly, allowing favorite apps on the Home Screen (instead of the most recently opened) would provide faster access to frequently used apps.
