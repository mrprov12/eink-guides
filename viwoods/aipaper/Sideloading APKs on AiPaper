## General Sideloading Steps

1. **Install a File Manager App:**
   - Use APKPure (available in the AiPaper App Store) to install a file manager app. Many users find **FX File Explorer** to work well.

2. **Download the APK:**
   - **Option 1: Direct Download**
     - Open Chrome (or any other browser on your AiPaper).
     - Navigate to the download page for the APK you wish to install and download the `.apk` file.
   - **Option 2: Transfer via File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**
     - If you have trouble downloading directly, you can transfer the `.apk` file to your AiPaper via FTP.
     - To do this, set up an FTP connection between your computer and AiPaper. Many file manager apps, like FX File Explorer, support FTP.
     - Upload the desired `.apk` file to the AiPaper’s **Download** folder (or a folder of your choice).

3. **Install the APK:**
   - Open the file manager app (like FX File Explorer).
   - Go to your **Download** folder (or wherever you saved the `.apk` file).
   - Click on the `.apk` file to initiate the installation.

4. **Enable Installation from Unknown Sources (if prompted):**
   - If the system prevents installation due to security settings, follow the prompt to open **Settings**.
   - Toggle the option to enable installation from unknown sources.
   - Return to the file manager and proceed with the installation.

5. **Accessing and Using the App:**
   - Once installed, the app should appear in your **Apps** section.
   - You can open and use the app normally.

6. **Updating Sideloaded Apps:**
   - To update, download the new version’s `.apk` file and repeat the above steps. When you click on the new file, you’ll be prompted to update rather than reinstall, and existing data/settings should remain intact.
