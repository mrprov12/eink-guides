# Q:Can I set a default template for new notes in Paper?
## A: How to Use Quick Notes and Linked Folders in Paper

While you can't set a template for the base note on the main tab in Paper (the rectangle with a `+`), you can create a "Quick Note" in the Paper app. Quick Notes allow you to use a specific template linked to a Folder tag, called a "Linked Folder." Here’s how it works:

Creating a Quick Note template will automatically create a Linked Folder with the same name. Whenever you select a template from the Quick Notes tab in Paper, it will:
- Create a document with that template loaded,
- Automatically store it in the Linked Folder associated with that Quick Note.

### Key Points about Quick Notes

- **Template-Specific Storage**: If you create a normal Note with a template also used as a Quick Note template, it won’t auto-store in the Linked Folder. Only Notes created from the Quick Notes tab or button will auto-store in the Linked Folder.
  
- **Flexible Template Usage**: After creating a Quick Note with a template, you can add pages with different templates without moving the note out of the Linked Folder. So, even if you start with a Quick Note template, you’re not locked into it for every page.

- **Renaming and File Management**: 
  - You can rename a Quick Note without it leaving the Linked Folder, so you aren’t limited to the generated filename.
  - Files auto-placed in a Linked Folder can be moved to a different folder if desired, giving you flexibility with file location.

### Documentation

- **Quick Notes**: See page 16 of the User Manual in Learning.
- **Linked Folders**: See pages 17-18 of the User Manual in Learning.

### Guide to Sideloading APKs on AiPaper Devices

Here’s a general guide on how to sideload APKs on your AiPaper device:

---

#### General Sideloading Steps

1. **Install a File Manager App:**
   - Use APKPure (available in the AiPaper App Store) to install a file manager app. Many users find **FX File Explorer** to work well.

2. **Download the APK:**
   - **Option 1: Direct Download**
     - Open Chrome (or any other browser on your AiPaper).
     - Navigate to the download page for the APK you wish to install and download the `.apk` file.
   - **Option 2: Transfer via File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**
     - If you have trouble downloading directly, you can transfer the `.apk` file to your AiPaper via FTP.
     - To do this, set up an FTP connection between your computer and AiPaper. Many file manager apps, like FX File Explorer, support FTP.
     - Upload the desired `.apk` file to the AiPaper’s **Download** folder (or a folder of your choice).

3. **Install the APK:**
   - Open the file manager app (like FX File Explorer).
   - Go to your **Download** folder (or wherever you saved the `.apk` file).
   - Click on the `.apk` file to initiate the installation.

4. **Enable Installation from Unknown Sources (if prompted):**
   - If the system prevents installation due to security settings, follow the prompt to open **Settings**.
   - Toggle the option to enable installation from unknown sources.
   - Return to the file manager and proceed with the installation.

5. **Accessing and Using the App:**
   - Once installed, the app should appear in your **Apps** section.
   - You can open and use the app normally.

6. **Updating Sideloaded Apps:**
   - To update, download the new version’s `.apk` file and repeat the above steps. When you click on the new file, you’ll be prompted to update rather than reinstall, and existing data/settings should remain intact.

# Q: How do I get xyz app onto my AiPaper?
## A: (v3.1.2) Sideloading through APKPure or directly from .apk files
As of v3.1.2, there are two options for installing applications not native to the device:
1) Install through APKPure
APKPure is an application avaialble in the AiPaper's native App Store. Once it is installed, you have the ability to search for apps you'd like to install and install them directly from their APKs through APKPure's UI. They will then show up in the 'Apps' section of your home screen, or on the 'Apps' page.
2) Sideload directly from .apk files
   - Please see the above guide to sideloading directly from apk files in the answer to the previous question.

## A: (v3.1.4+) Google Play Store
As of v3.1.4 (currently in beta as of Nov 13th, 2024), AiPaper will have the ability to install the Google Play Store. While you will still have the ability to use APKPure or traditional sideloading of .apk files, you will also have the ability to download your favorite apps directly from the Google Play Store. This also allows you to use apps that depend on the Google Play Store to run.

# Q: Does the Viwoods AiPaper offer screen-sharing capabilities?
## A: Screen Sharing on Viwoods AiPaper
